# AgL implementation architecture

## Six-component pipeline

```
source (.agl)
  → [1] custom lexer  (INDENT/DEDENT, multiline strings, string interpolation)
  → [2] Lark LALR parser  (grammar in grammar/agl.lark)
  → [3] AST  (pure dataclasses, NO Lark types)   ◄── stable contract / firewall
  → [4] scope / name resolution  (full static pass)
  → [5] type checking  (full static pass; selects output contract specs)
  → host preparation  (materializes output contracts; no program execution)
  → [6] evaluator  (tree-walking interpreter)
        ↘ host runtime: agents, codecs, renderers, trace store
```

## Firewall rule

Components **1→2** are the only Lark-aware code. Component **3** (the AST in
`agm.agl.syntax`) is the *firewall*: everything from component 3 onward depends
**only** on the AST dataclasses, **never** on Lark. This is what makes the
lexer+parser replaceable (e.g. by a tree-sitter front end) without touching
scope, typecheck, or eval.

## Side-table annotation convention

Later passes (scope, typecheck) attach information to AST nodes via **side tables
keyed by the per-node `node_id`** (a monotonic integer assigned by the AST
builder). Do NOT mutate frozen AST nodes, and do NOT use `id()` hashing. The
side tables live in `ResolvedProgram` (scope pass output) and `CheckedProgram`
(typecheck pass output).

## Decimal arithmetic context

AgL semantics must not depend on the host's ambient `decimal` context. The
evaluator (`agm.agl.eval.interpreter`) runs every program under a pinned
`decimal.Context` (`_AGL_DECIMAL_CONTEXT`: 28-digit precision, `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`)
via `decimal.localcontext` in `Interpreter.execute`. A host that lowered
`getcontext().prec` would otherwise change results such as `1 / 3`.

## Incremental REPL session

`agm.agl.repl.session.ReplSession` is a UI-free incremental driver that runs the
same `parse → resolve → check → host-prep → eval` pipeline **one entry at a
time** against a *persistent* environment (session scope, type env, value scope,
declared inputs, pending pre-seeded inputs, source log). It reuses the firewalled
passes' seam parameters:
`parse_program_seeded` (globally-unique node ids across entries),
`resolve(..., parent_scope=...)` (refs fall through to session bindings; new
decls shadow), and `check(..., seed_env=...)` (seed with prior decls/binding
types). Each entry executes **only its own statements** in a child value scope,
so agent calls fire exactly once and a later entry reads stored `Value`s rather
than re-invoking. Promotion into the session is **atomic** — a runtime raise
(`AglRaise`) OR an agent-call cancellation (`AgentCancelled` / `KeyboardInterrupt`
from the confirming wrapper) discards ALL of the entry's in-session effects via a
shared `_rollback` helper: new `let`/`var` bindings (held in the child scope) AND
any `set` mutation of a prior session binding (rolled back from a value snapshot
taken before eval, since `set` only updates an existing binding's value and never
changes the value scope's key set). Only genuinely external effects already issued
during evaluation (agent calls, `exec` shell commands) are irreversible.

Pre-seeded inputs (`--input KEY=VALUE` / `preset_input`) are applied when the
matching `input` declaration is promoted (or immediately if already declared); a
conversion failure leaves the input unset rather than erroring.

The session shares the host-environment assembly, input conversion, and
exception→`RunError` mapping with `WorkflowRuntime` via public helpers in
`agm.agl.runtime.runtime` (`assemble_host_environment`/`HostEnvironment`,
`convert_input`, `exception_value_to_run_error`); registration is delegated to an
internal `WorkflowRuntime` so reserved-name/duplicate validation is not
duplicated. `EchoInterpreter` (a thin `Interpreter` subclass) captures a trailing
bare-expression's value for echoing without re-evaluating it.

Agent calls are gated by `agm.agl.repl.agents.ConfirmingAgent`, a wrapper
`AgentFn` holding a shared mutable `AgentMode` (`confirm`/`auto`, also mutated by
the `:agent` meta-command) and an injected confirmation callback. In confirm mode
it asks before each live call; `no` raises `AgentCancelled`, `always` flips the
mode to auto. A `KeyboardInterrupt` during a live call (the runner subprocess runs
in its own process group, so on Ctrl-C the parent group-kills it in
`core/process.py` and re-raises) is converted to `AgentCancelled`. The wrapper is UI-free; the console supplies the real `[Y/n/a]`
prompt via `make_console_confirm`. Per-entry tracing: when a `trace_path` is set,
each evaluated entry opens its own `TraceStore` (a fresh `run_id`) appending JSONL
to the one file, bracketed by `run_start`/`run_end`; `check_only` writes no trace.
`exec` shell-call confirmation is out of scope (the shell path lives inside the
interpreter, not the agent registry). The `agm repl` command builds ONE
`AgentMode` and passes that same instance to both the wrapper and the console.

## Package layout and test locations

| Package | Component | Tests |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| `agm.agl.lexer` | 1 — custom lexer | `tests/test_agl_lexer.py` |
| `agm.agl.grammar` | 2 — Lark grammar | `tests/test_agl_parser.py` |
| `agm.agl.syntax` | 3 — AST dataclasses | `tests/test_agl_ast.py` |
| `agm.agl.scope` | 4 — name resolution | `tests/test_agl_scope.py` |
| `agm.agl.typecheck` | 5 — type checking | `tests/test_agl_typecheck.py` |
| `agm.agl.eval` | 6 — evaluator | `tests/test_agl_eval.py` |
| `agm.agl.runtime` | host API | `tests/test_agl_runtime.py` |
| `agm.agl.repl` | incremental REPL session (UI-free) | `tests/test_agl_repl_session.py` |
| `agm.commands.exec` | CLI command | `tests/test_exec_command.py` |

The end-to-end acceptance suite lives in `tests/test_agl_e2e.py` and
`tests/agl/`. It is **green and part of the standing gate** — `just test` /
`just check` include it with no `--ignore` flag.  All new AgL work must keep
this suite green.
